# Mammographic-Masses-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Script

The script is an example of a classification problem solved with Machine Learning.  The script explors and analyzes mammographic masses . This script provides a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that performs various data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. The notebook utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to load the data, handle missing values, and perform data correction. It offers an interactive environment to explore the dataset's characteristics, including columns like BI-RADS, Age, Shape, Margin, Density, and Severity.

With this script, you can efficiently learn how to clean the data and correct any inconsistencies, such as replacing missing values with NaN and transforming the data types appropriately. The notebook guides you through the process of exploring the dataset, providing valuable information about unique values in each column and the distribution of data points. Additionally, the script performs data filtering to focus on specific aspects of the dataset. Finally, the classification problem is approached using several classification algorithms, the best hyperparameters have been tuned using grid search and the model diagnostics are presented.
